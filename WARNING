Warning, this code is very much beta work.  Unless you want to help debug/improve the code don't use this in
production just yet (well you can but I'm not standing behind my work quite yet).

This release is purely to garnish a bit of attention and get the basis of a project ready.  

You are, of course, free todo whatever you want with this code.  You've been warned.
