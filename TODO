Things TODO

Short term goals [say around June] 
   - Stable code, demos to show for it
   - Completed user manual

For v0.02 
   - Make sure all of the functions are consistent as to where they take the source
    characteristic from the rightmost argument
   - Get the pb_invmod to work
   - Get the core functions [add/sub/mul/div] stable by testing their dependents [grow/init/copy more]
   - Add a pb_exptmod, pb_isirreducible and various helper functions (e.g. to work with constants)
   - Add more to the testing demo
   - Add a MSVC makefile
   - Add some examples to manual

Down the road
   - Add a Karatsuba multiplier for larger polynomials and add a tuning function
   - write a division algo for Z[x]
   - Some form of trace function?
