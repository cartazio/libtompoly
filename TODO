Things TODO

Short term goals [say around June] 
   - Stable code, demos to show for it
   - Completed user manual

Down the road
   - Add a Karatsuba multiplier for larger polynomials and add a tuning function
   - write a division algo for Z[x]
   - Some form of trace function?
   - I/O functions (to_raw, read_raw)
